## Basic Processing Android App

This app helps you to load the *.apk file into your mobile phone via micro usb. While using the Processing, sometimes it's better to use the mobile phone directly instead of using the emulator. Emulator is bit sluggish and it won't work in many case.

IMHO : Run your mobile app directly on phone.

### How-To Use

1. Enable the debug option in your mobile phone settings
2. connect the micro usb cable, mostly it shall try to install drivers automatically if not install the necessary drivers
3. If you installed the drivers and didn't work means, then restart you system so that you can able to load app in phone.
